This project uses Neurosity EEG to captures sessions of brain activity to a local disc.

The software development kit for the Neurosity can be found here: https://docs.neurosity.co/docs/reference/classes/notion.

In the long term, the goal is to create a multi-modal system (heart rate, respiration rate, brain states, video capture, etc) that securely captures data from a session, which can be used to gain insight into training (sessions of meditation, creativity, problem solving, etc).
